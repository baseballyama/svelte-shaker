'svelte-shaker': patch
---

First public release of svelte-shaker — a sound, source-level tree-shaker for Svelte 5 (runes) components. It partially evaluates each `.svelte` file against how the whole app uses it (unused/constant props folded, dead `{#if}` arms and unreachable `<style>` rules removed) before the Svelte compiler runs, never changing observable behavior. Ships a Vite plugin (`svelte-shaker/vite`).
